  <h1>Events</h1>
  <p>
    ECSS runs numerous social events throughout the year for its members. These range from industry events with top employers
    to nightlife events (alcohol is not mandatory!) to board game evenings.
  </p>
  <p>
    The timeline below shows some of our top events we have planned for 2018/19. We will also be running smaller events so that there will be at least one event per week. You can check what events are on at our <a href='https://www.facebook.com/ecss.soton/'>Facebook page</a>.
