    <h1>Netball</h1>
    <p>
      This year we are joining up with the Physoc and with the SUES (Southampton University Engineering Society) to create a womenâ€™s netball team. We welcome players of any ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      The team will train and play weekly, and participate in tournaments throughout the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the team is new for 2017/2018, the team, and sports reps from each society, will be looking for players to take up the roles of captain, vice captain and social sec.
    </p>
