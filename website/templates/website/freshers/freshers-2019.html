    <h2>Jumpstart</h2>
    <p>
      Jumpstart is an opportunity for ECS freshers to meet other students in ECS, take part in a range of activities, and settle into Southampton. It is our first ECSS event of the year, and is sponsored by IBM. You can learn more at the <a href="{% url 'website:jumpstart-2019' %}">Jumpstart page</a>.
