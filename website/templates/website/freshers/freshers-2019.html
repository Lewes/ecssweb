    <h1>ECSS Freshers 2019</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome freshers! We are a student run society within Electronics and Computer Science (ECS) at the University of Southampton. We run a range of events throughout the terms including socials, video games and board games events, talks and workshops from industry. We also host the ECS Christmas party at the end of the first term, hackathons (including a big one planned this year) and the end of year BBQ. We do our very popular members' clothing orders every year (normally once a year so don't miss out), and some of the designs are from our members!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not required to sign up as an ECSS member to come to most of our events, however, some events which space is limited may require sign up for the events and some have additional benefits for ECS/ECSS members (e.g. we offered free drink tokens for ECS members at the ECS Christmas party). You can get our events updates on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ecss.soton/events/" title="ECSS Facebook events page">our Facebook events page</a>. Most of our events are free to come and have free pizza or snacks provided (thanks to <a href="{% url 'website:sponsors' %}" title="ECSS sponsors">our sponsors</a> who make these happen), however, some of the events require a charge which we make it as small as possible to put into the events.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can find out more about the current <a href="{% url 'website:committee-overview' %}" title="ECSS committee">ECSS committee</a> and talk to the members in person around campus. If you are interested in joining the committee, look out for information about committee elections and AGM which is normally held in March or April.
